In connection with this, the Portal and any e-mails sent from the Portal may utilize cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and is stored on your computer’s hard drive.

In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any PII that has been combined, unless specifically disclosed otherwise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: &apos;times new roman&apos;, times;&quot;&gt;Information from Other Sources.

Accel also reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that Accel, in good faith, believes to be unlawful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: &apos;times new roman&apos;, times;&quot;&gt;Accel reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including PII, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, financing, the sale of substantially all assets, or other corporate change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: &apos;times new roman&apos;, times;&quot;&gt;The Portal web server automatically collects certain non-personally identifiable information (&quot;Non-PII&quot;), such as the address (or &quot;URL&quot;) of the web site that you came from before visiting the Portal, which pages you visit on the Portal, which browser you used to view the Portal, and IP address. In connection with this, the Portal and any e-mails sent from the Portal may utilize cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a web server and is stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie is essentially your identification card when you return to the Portal. You can set your browser to reject the cookies, although rejecting cookies might affect your ability to use the Portal. A web beacon is a small, often invisible, graphic image included in a web page or e-mail. We may use web beacons for many purposes, such as to count visitors to the Portal or to monitor how visitors navigate the Portal. Accel may share Non-PII, such as aggregate user statistics, with potential partners and other third parties. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This Privacy Policy does not apply to PII collected in these circumstances. However, we may combine the PII we collect from you offline with information that we collect through the Portal. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any PII that has been combined, unless specifically disclosed otherwise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: &apos;times new roman&apos;, times;&quot;&gt;Information from Other Sources.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: &apos;times new roman&apos;, times;&quot;&gt;Accel may share PII when we believe in good faith that the law requires it; at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; to verify or enforce compliance with our Terms of Use or other Accel policies; or whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability or to protect or enforce the rights, interests, or safety of the Portal, users or other third parties. Accel also reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that Accel, in good faith, believes to be unlawful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11pt; font-family: &apos;times new roman&apos;, times;&quot;&gt;Accel reserves the right to disclose and transfer user information, including PII, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, financing, the sale of substantially all assets, or other corporate change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
